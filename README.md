PCBFeet
=======

A simple footprint editor for gEDA PCB.

Creating PCB footprints is hard, and I do it a lot.  I've been bitching about this for a long time, so it's time to fix the problem.  

This project is a simple CAD for editing footprints.  It is built around GTK 3.0, so it should be portable (I will address it later), but for now Linux is the only target.

STATUS:
======

Early prototype.  
Parser: almost done, no flags yet.  Loading from test.fp
Display: Zoom with mouse wheel; click sets grid origin. 

TODO: rulers, object selection and modification, object entry dialogs, layers, etc.
