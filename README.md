PCBFeet
=======

A simple footprint editor for gEDA PCB.

Creating PCB footprints is hard, and I do it a lot.  I've been bitching about this for a long time, so it's time to fix the problem.  

This project is a simple CAD for editing footprints.  It is built around GTK 3.0, so it should be portable (I will address it later), but for now Linux is the only target.

STATUS:

Early prototype.  Zoom with mouse wheel; click sets grid origin. Simple pad is visible.
